	/**
	* These are fake credentials below. Don't even bother trying to use them.
	*
	* Now listen up. The identity field seems to screw everyone up. This is how it works.
	* Whatsapp needs a unique string, 20 characters long when you register, for it to keep track of the device using the service.
	* When you use THIS API, the identity token provided gets urldecoded to see if it's 20 characters long.
	*
	* If it is NOT 20 characters long, the identity token gets hashed using sha1, then urlencoded (so we can save/use it easily as a string)
	* and finally converted to lower case. This now gives us a unique (to us) 20 character long string.
	*
	* If you provide a string (either already URLencoded or a string that when urlDecoded is 20 characters long) that will be used instead of
	* any processing by the API. This allows you to use an identity that you might already know or have received using another problem eg WART.
	*
	* It's up to you.
